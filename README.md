# App Name: CALLÂ·IT: Sports Picks

## Core Concept
CALLÂ·IT is a flexible social gaming platform where players compete by making predictions on sports outcomes. The platform supports multiple sports and tournament formats, emphasizing community, competition, and customizable gameplay.

## Game Modes

### Standings Mode
Predict the final rankings of teams within a structured competition (e.g., divisions, groups, pools, or conferences).

### Standings & Records Mode
Predict each teamâ€™s final record. Standings are auto-calculated based on win/loss totals. Ties can be manually reordered.

### Matchup Mode (Weekly Picks)
Predict the outcome of individual games, matches, or events. Configurable by organizers as:
- **Per Game Locking**: Each game locks individually at kickoff.
- **Per Window Locking**: Entire week locks at the first gameâ€™s kickoff.

Results in this mode also feed into projected standings and performance outcomes.

## Customizable Group Play

### Public & Private Groups
Compete with friends in private invite-only groups or join public groups to test your skills against the wider community.

### Organizer Controls
Group creators define how the game is played, including:
- **Scoring Method** â€“ Points system or pick accuracy percentage.
- **Midpoint Revisions** â€“ Option to revise long-term predictions once during a season or tournament, with scoring penalties applied.
- **Pick Frequency** â€“ Set submission windows (per day, per week, per round, etc.).
- **Lock Times** â€“ Lock all picks per window or per game.
- **Missed Predictions** â€“ Default to Vegas favorite (Autopick) or score zero.

## Scoring & Leaderboards

### Multi-Layered Scoring
- **Exact outcomes** (correct rank, score, or winner).
- **Near misses** (partial credit).
- **Perfect predictions** (bonus points).

### Leaderboards
Track results in private groups and global leaderboards, filterable by sport, competition, and game mode.
